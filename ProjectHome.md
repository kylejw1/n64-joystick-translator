Every original Nintendo 64 controller suffers from loose joystick syndrome eventually, and the third party controllers leave much to be desired.

The PIC translator board provides a means to swap the original joystick to another joystick of your choice.

Assembly of the controller from scratch is of moderate difficulty, and requires some cutting, soldering, and a PIC programmer.

To use a different microcontroller (PIC, AVR, etc), the source code is available via the link at the top.  It will need to be ported for most other chips.
